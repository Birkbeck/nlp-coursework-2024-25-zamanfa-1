One limitation Flesch-Kincaid (FK) score has is that it relies on syllable counts optimised for standard American English pronunciation. It becomes unreliable for :
- Text with non-native English structures
- Dialects with different phonetic rules
The syllable-counting heuristic often misjudges such cases which may skew the estimates.

Another limitation is that Fk measures syntactic complexity (word/sentence length) but ignores semantic difficulty:
- Technical papers with concise sentences but complex concepts may score low
- Poetry or lyrics with intentional syntactic complexity may score high despite being conceptually simple
The formula cannot account for domain-specific terminology or abract ideas that affect real comprehension diffculty.

FK score works best for standardized English with predictable vocabulary and linear syntax, not for non-conventional texts.
